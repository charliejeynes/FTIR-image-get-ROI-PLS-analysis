FTIR image get ROI &amp; PLS analysis 

This is a set of matlab scripts which allow the user to set up a root folder to Agilent Cary 630 collected FTIR hyper spcectral images, open then (the image is displayed as a summed image) and pick out spectra using a region of interest freehand tool. The spectra are then grouped and either PLS-DA or PCA can be run on the them to see if they can be separted out into groups.

This was used to analyse data from 67 slices from Tau and WT samples
